# Data check steps

- Data check
  - Run main node with all sources and feeds (except custom ones) for few minutes, redirect output to local-node-run.log
  - Run script to analyze logs and print insights
    - What sources failed
    - What symbols failed (and why)
- Fix sources and check again
  - Fix sources
    - CCXT sources
      - Upgrade to the latest version of CCXT sources
      - Run CCXT scripts to sync data feeds and data sources
    - Remove sources that do not exist anymore or are not reliable
      - Remove corresponding manifests
      - Remove corresponding fetchers (for ccxt source - remove it from the ccxt sources list, for other - remove code)
      - Regenerate all dependent data-services manifests
- Remove incorrect data feeds (symbols)
  - Run the step 1 (Data check again)
  - Fix symbols
    - For symbol fetching failing on all sources - remo this symbol
    - For deviation on the symbols or invalid values on some sources - manually remove this symbol from incorrect sources manifests
  - Regenerate all dependent data-services manifests
- Add more symbols
  - If the number of symbols drops below 1000, add new tokens from coingecko (TODO: add a link to the instruction)
